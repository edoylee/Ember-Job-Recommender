We are inventing new and engaging ad experiences for customers on mobile. As a leader and engineer you will have the freedom, support and encouragement to experiment and invent on behalf of our customers. We trust you to come up with compelling new interactive mobile ad experiences. You will think big and turn vision into reality — not be constrained by resources available to you today or today’s market environments. You’ll straddle both the product perspective and engineering execution while holding the entire problem-space in your head. Paul Graham wrote an essay about the importance of this principle: http://paulgraham.com/head.html. We like to think that it’s more than the software that our engineers need to hold all at once in their heads — it’s also the customer experience, the design, and the product. This allows you to look around the corner, move efficiently, develop concrete plans, and take advantage of opportunities to solve problems with long-term thinking. We need a highly collaborative teammate, but also one-person wrecking crew — someone who gets a lot done with very little resources and lots of ambiguity.

As a Development Manager, you'll build an elite team of Development Engineers to define, drive and execute on this vision. You will initiate processes that allow the team to collaborate with partner teams in Amazon with a high degree of efficiency. You'll develop your team of highly motivated and talented individuals who can collaborate with Program Managers, Product Managers and SDEs across the company on high impact initiatives. You will design, build and own beautiful new features and solutions that will delight our customers.

• Assure that your team's designs meet requirements, and deliver high-quality work on tight schedules.

• Monitor operation of production services to ensure Operational Excellence.
• Career management and fostering the development of your direct reports.
