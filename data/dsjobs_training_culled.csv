Recommending products to Amazon customers – yes, that is the space that we work in. We blend a variety of disciplines (such as recommender systems, data mining, NLP, big data and ML) to turn an intractable problem into a hard problem. For example: just because someone bought a purple dress does not mean that purple is the right color for them for all seasons; neither does it mean that you should recommend purple accessories. Just when someone buys a sofa, which rug in Amazon’s vast selection would it make most sense to pair with it? While there are other recommendation problems out there, none of them capture the scale of the problem, the rapidly changing inventory along with unique problems of fit, fabric and finish.

So how do we do it?

If you want to be on the cutting edge of personalization in ecommerce retail and reaching customers in a unique and valuable space, this is the team to be on! We have the mandate and ability to effect big changes, we just need the right person to begin.

As an Applied Scientist, you will work with other applied scientists, dev teams, engineers and product managers. You will own and build infrastructure that accesses terabyte of data to produce and deliver datasets with low latency and high reliability. The goal is to innovate new discovery features that can make a huge impact on the customer experience. What recommendations data could you use to make search more personalized? How can we use product similarity and sales data to augment and enrich our recommendations? How can we influence customers to drive long term value to Amazon?
We are looking for people who innovate, love solving hard problems, understand both technology and business, and have a great judgement skills. You will be able to build systems that will impact millions of customers and create multi-million dollar revenue opportunities, ship in just a couple of weeks and instantly measure the impact of what you have developed. And be able to go home and show your friends and family how you change the world!

We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies. We've been named among Seattle's ""Best Places to Work"" in Seattle Met magazine, Seattle Business Magazine, and the Puget Sound Business Journal."" We're also a recipient of Seattle Business Magazine's 2015 Tech Impact Awards. Needless to say (but we're going to say it anyway)we love dogs, and we wouldn't dream of going to work without them by our sides.

What does Data Science mean at Rover?
At Rover we obsess over our customers needs, relying heavily on data to improve the customer journey, and to continuously optimize outcomes in our marketplaces. Our entire organization is metric driven and underpinned by data science. Data scientists are responsible for defining the right metrics, understanding nuanced marketplace dynamics, and developing models and algorithms that power our business and technology.

Core responsibilities for the data science team include:

1. Multivariate modeling: the creation of models that lead to better search outcomes, providing better matches between pet sitters and owners. Here, success is measured in terms of impact on marketplace efficiency.

2. Machine learning: the ongoing development of the machine learning infrastructure that enables continuous learning from our data, where success is also measured in terms of marketplace efficiency gains as well as the rate at which different aspects of the user experience are incorporated into our ML systems.

3. Scaling user testing: the parallelization and democratization of end-user testing across all areas of the product and user experience, where success is measured in terms of testing velocity across the organization

Who we're looking for:
Rover seeks an experienced data scientist with a strong background in statistical modeling and experience as a manager or lead, to lead a team of data scientists in a hands-on capacity while working cross-functionally to build scalable solutions to complex problems.

This is a non-trivial responsibility: on the one hand, there is tremendous value to be driven in continuing to optimize the Rover marketplace, while on the other hand the opportunity cost associated with long-running experiments (in time and dollars) is very high.

We are looking for someone who understands that behind every data point there is a pet and a pet person. When you develop and deploy an algorithm, you are not just producing a score or rule set, you are altering the customer experience and impacting the business in measurable ways. You should be excited to grow a team that tackles a broad array of problems and work in a fast-paced, collaborative startup environment.

Youre a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business).

Are you ready to test your skills using massive amounts of information to make critical business decisions?

Groupon’s mission is to become the daily habit in local commerce and fulfill our purpose of building strong communities through thriving small businesses by connecting people to a vibrant, global marketplace for local services, experiences and goods. In the process, we’re positively impacting the lives of millions of customers and merchants globally. Even with thousands of employees spread across multiple continents, we still maintain a culture that inspires innovation, rewards risk-taking and celebrates success. If you want to take more ownership of your career, then you're ready to be part of Groupon.

As a part of our Technology organization, our Data Science team strives to be the voice of the customer in the decisions Groupon makes. We develop and use cutting-edge data technologies and data science algorithms to sift through large amounts of data and distill it into information about our customers' wants and needs. We then integrate these insights into our automated decision-making systems to constantly improve our services.

At Groupon, data drives our decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist who will join an influential team in the Groupon Goods department. You will get an opportunity to build production algorithms and data products as well as guide the product roadmap by deriving meaningful insights from the wealth of big data we have from our customers, logistics networks, and suppliers. You will be testing your models and hypotheses against the data, giving critical opinions about next actions, and communicating your findings to the broader team. You will get to see your work rapidly feed back into the evolution of our products.

We're a ""best of both worlds"" kind of company. We're big enough to have resources and scale, but small enough that a single person has a surprising amount of autonomy and can make a meaningful impact. We're curious, fun, a little intense, and kind of obsessed with helping local businesses thrive. Does that sound like a compelling place to work?

You’ll spend time on the following:
You will design and develop processes and systems to consolidate and analyze unstructured, diverse data sources to generate actionable insights
You will work with product and service teams to identify questions and issues for data analysis and experimentation
You will develop and code software programs, algorithms, and automated processes to cleanse, integrate, and evaluate large datasets from multiple disparate sources
Identify meaningful insights from large data and metadata sources; interpret and communicate insights and findings from analysis and experiments to partners across the organization
Quantify the potential value of new product hypotheses
Design and support large-scale multivariate tests to prove out new ideas
Work with product management and engineering to develop KPIs for new features and instrumentation to quantify the adoption of new product initiatives
We’re excited about you if you have:
3-5 years work experience as a data scientist or a related role
Master’s degree in Finance, Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics or similar
Understanding of applied math topics, such as probability and statistics, linear algebra, basic optimization techniques, etc.
Proficiency with SQL, Hadoop, or other Map/Reduce (or other scripting language)
You have hands-on experience with predictive analytics tools and machine learning techniques/algorithms
You're a creative problem solver who identifies problems unilaterally and recommends effective plans of action
Ability to use predictive modeling such as k-nearest neighbors, random forests, ensemble methods
Ability to understand and use software engineering techniques - parsing through data logs, leading instrumentation specifications and implementation, using and rewriting APIs, integrating APIs with data tools, knowledge and integration through flux
Experience with data visualization and presentation
Experience defining and analyzing multivariate tests
Advanced proficiency in Excel, Tableau (or other data visualization software), R, Matlab, Stata (or other statistical modeling package)
You have experience translating business objectives and problems into analytic problems, and analytic solutions into actionable business solutions"
