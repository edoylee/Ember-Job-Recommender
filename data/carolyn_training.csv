0,"Glowforge is a beautiful device that sits on your desk. It uses a laser to carve and engrave products from raw materials like wood, leather, acrylic – even cardboard.
There is an incredible demand for what we’re creating. It’s not a geeky tool for the tech elite or a garage workshop; we’re crafting an iconic product that is going to change the way people think about creativity. Our customers include consumers, digital designers, crafters, engineers, teachers, artists, and more. It’s already the biggest crowdfunding campaign in history, and now that it’s available at retail, the fun is really starting.
This is a full-time role in Seattle, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this beautiful city.
Why We Need You
We have the best customers, and our company is going to succeed or fail based on the experience they have with their Glowforge. When customers are thinking about purchasing a Glowforge printer, Proofgrade Materials, or a Design, they reach out us. When they have great things to say, they let us know. When they experience a challenge, they’ll come to us expecting us to make it right. That’s where you come in. You are their hero. You’re the one who gets them through when they’re stuck, turns failures into successes, and makes our company’s passion for our customers real for each and every person who reaches out.
Here’s what you’ll be doing
This is a full-time role in Seattle, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this beautiful city.
You’re going to answer questions from before purchase through to printing success or, occasionally, warranty return. You’ll spend most of your time troubleshooting new or difficult issues for our customers. You’ll pride yourself on your empathy, patience, and creative problem-solving skills. Laser aficionados and newbies alike will be delighted to talk to you and rave to their friends about the top-notch customer service you provide.
In between customer interactions, you’ll notice patterns and come up with ideas about what we can do to improve. You’ll help us tune our processes to make things perfect for our customers.
Learning really, really fast. You don’t know how Glowforge hardware or software works, and that’s OK. We’ll teach you! You’ll learn, and then teach our customers.
Troubleshooting for our customers — Why hasn’t their shipment arrived? Why didn’t their purchase go through? Why did that thing not work for them?
Answering tickets about Glowforge software, hardware, materials and designs, shipping, account administration, how to design for the Glowforge, and more.
Paying attention to what our customers are thrilled and bothered by, and using that help our team improve our process and our product.
Keeping a positive disposition and level head even during the worst of times - late on a holiday when someone’s rightfully upset because something’s broken, and you’re the only one they have to talk to about it.
You need these qualifications
You have professional experience working closely with a variety of people helping them solve their problems.
You’re a tenacious troubleshooter, comfortable diving into data or dialing strangers to delve into the unknown. You’re organized, insightful, and undaunted by conflicting priorities.
You love helping people, and are fast, thoughtful, and efficient about how you do it.
You write well, communicate clearly, and listen like a champion.
You’re available to work late hours and holidays during peak periods.
You love making things with your hands - 3D printing, knitting, woodworking, furniture building, doesn’t matter what.
It would be nice if…
You’ve supported customers in a high-performance, adaptable customer service, technical support or help desk team.
You’re an experienced technical writer or community manager
You’re experienced with one or more design tools like Illustrator, Photoshop, Inkscape, or CAD programs.
You have a four-year degree or equivalent experience
You have examples of your support experience - for example, a manual you’ve written or public posts on a support board
You have experience at a small company like a tech startup.
Please send us your resume, and – more importantly – a cover letter that tells us about your interest here. If you have public examples of your writing, like a blog or website, please send us a link to those too. We’re excited to meet you!
One more, very important thing: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We’re strongly committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all employees and all applicants for employment. For us, this is the only acceptable way to do business.",0.0

Glowforge isn’t just a beautiful piece of hardware, it’s a living growing platform that includes hardware, cloud based software, a catalog of designs and a community of talented makers exploring the limits of what they can do with their Glowforge printer.
We want our customers to be delighted with their Glowforge but sometimes they hit a snag and need a little help. You’re one of the keys to their success, connecting the dots from an unexpected print experience to the piece of hardware that would cause their problem whether it’s a loose belt, damaged wheel or something else entirely. You’ll clear the roadblocks and help them navigate the system so our customers can get back to realizing their vision and making their creations. When our customers hit a snag you’ll be the difference between them walking away frustrated or coming away informed and excited to use their Glowforge for years to come.
Here's what you'll be doing
Troubleshooting the tricky questions. Why did a customer’s Glowforge unit make that noise? Is the laser supposed to do that? Why did that thing not work?
Communicating elegantly. You’ll respond to our customer’s complex questions with easy to understand emails, and you’ll work across departments at Glowforge to identify solutions.
Writing. You’ll create both technical troubleshooting documents that are used by the team internally and self service articles that get our customers back on track.
Building. You’ll be paying attention to what our customers are thrilled and bothered by, and you’ll lead projects to develop our systems, policies, and processes. You’ll help the rest of the team learn and grow, too.
Breathing. You’ll keep a positive disposition and level head even during the worst of times - like late on a holiday when a customer is rightfully upset because something’s broken, and you’re the only one they have to talk to about it.
You need these qualifications
You have a four-year technical degree or equivalent experience.
You have professional experience working closely with a variety of people and helping them solve their problems.
You are very good at troubleshooting technical problems involving computer controlled mechanical devices.
You write well, communicate clearly, and listen like a champion.
It would be nice if...
You have 3+ years of experience working with customers to solve their technical challenges.
Your motto is “I can fix that.” You are the person who family and friends go to for answers when their technology isn’t working, and you love it.
You have experience working with 3D printers, CNC mills, laser cutter/engravers, or other fabrication technology.
You have experience working with vector design or CAD software, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Fusion 360, Solidworks or similar

Company Overview

80% of the global working population - 2.7 billion people - are deskless workers, with agriculture making up the largest single segment at nearly 900 million. Just in the last five years, most of those deskless workers acquired their first cell phone. In the US, approximately 90 percent of farmworkers have a smartphone now. And yet, growers still manage their workforce using phone calls, clipboards and paperwork.

Here in the U.S. an estimated $3.1B in fresh produce is left in the field due to a worsening farmworker labor shortage as farmworkers leave the industry. Turnover on many farms is very high. Farmers are having to do more with fewer people. And farmworkers don't have it easy either--sexual harassment and injury rates are higher than most industries, and even if wages are good during peak season, annual earnings for farmworker families are among the lowest in the nation.

Ganaz is a workforce management platform for agriculture that addresses shared pain points between employers and workers, in a way that makes a real difference for both.

You are a team player leading the charge with exceptional customer service skills, a passion for patient care and a strong ability to learn new software.

In our new markets and smaller clinics our Patient Service Specialist also assists the clinicians in their day to day work.

As an integral part of the patient care team, you will be asked to think quickly on your feet to ensure that patients are comfortable during their therapy sessions while connecting with them to provide a customer service experience like no other. The secret to success at ATI is to exceed customer expectations by providing the highest quality of care in a friendly and encouraging environment and you are on the front lines of delivery.

Your Purpose at ATI:

To be that memorable moment--partnering with the teams both in the clinic and corporate to ensure that every patient receives the care and attention that they will rave about to their friends and families. This is accomplished by emotionally investing and engaging with patients as well as teammates to understand and meet their needs. Our patients want to feel better physically, have a clinic that can accommodate their schedule, be assured that we can get all necessary authorizations and that we can load their information accurately in our billing system to ensure clean and accurate insurance claims and patient statements. The plus side of receiving treatment in an ATI clinic is that they can also expect to enjoy coming to therapy because of our friendly and encouraging environment.

What’s cool about this job?

You will be part of a strong internal team focused on taking care of our patients including the following:

- Your days will be busy as a champion of ATI's culture and values, working alongside all members of the clinic team to make a positive difference in patients’ lives with each and every interaction while working in a friendly and encouraging environment.

- This is the opportunity to join the best and fastest growing Physical Therapy Company in the world while learning great skills that will help your personal and professional growth.

- You will receive excellent development from your on-site Clinic Director and as well as an off-site Office Manager as you receive the training and support needed to master the Patient Service Specialist role.

- Have true fun and partnership by participating in patient graduation celebrations, local charity days, dress up days and showing your ATI spirit to the patients, team and community.

What you need to be successful:

- Excellent customer service skills with the ability to multitask and set multiple priorities while providing an exceptional experience for anyone that enters the clinic.

- The ability to communicate effectively and professionally with everyone you interact with from patient to teammate to clinical leadership.

- Demonstrate enthusiasm, compassion and the friendly factor to make the day of our patients.

- Excellent telephone rapport building skills as well as strong computer skills to effectively assist our patients.
