We are inventing new and engaging ad experiences for customers on mobile. As a leader and engineer you will have the freedom, support and encouragement to experiment and invent on behalf of our customers. We trust you to come up with compelling new interactive mobile ad experiences. You will think big and turn vision into reality — not be constrained by resources available to you today or today’s market environments. You’ll straddle both the product perspective and engineering execution while holding the entire problem-space in your head. Paul Graham wrote an essay about the importance of this principle: http://paulgraham.com/head.html. We like to think that it’s more than the software that our engineers need to hold all at once in their heads — it’s also the customer experience, the design, and the product. This allows you to look around the corner, move efficiently, develop concrete plans, and take advantage of opportunities to solve problems with long-term thinking. We need a highly collaborative teammate, but also one-person wrecking crew — someone who gets a lot done with very little resources and lots of ambiguity.

As a Development Manager, you'll build an elite team of Development Engineers to define, drive and execute on this vision. You will initiate processes that allow the team to collaborate with partner teams in Amazon with a high degree of efficiency. You'll develop your team of highly motivated and talented individuals who can collaborate with Program Managers, Product Managers and SDEs across the company on high impact initiatives. You will design, build and own beautiful new features and solutions that will delight our customers.


Responsibilities
• You'll lead the overall development life cycle of the solutions and manage complex projects with significant bottom line impact.
• Work with our team's product managers to develop a strategy and road map to provide compelling customer experiences and capabilities.
• Cooperate with our senior engineers to develop the best technical design and approach for new product development.
• Assure that your team's designs meet requirements, and deliver high-quality work on tight schedules.

Robotic systems are some of the most complex and interconnected hardware and software systems the world has ever seen. Technology is advancing fast, especially driven by recent progress in control, perception, simulation, and learning, quickly making new applications in manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and homes plausible. But many of these tools, techniques, algorithms, and ideas are inaccessible to the numerous entrepreneurs, engineers, artists, business leaders, or healthcare professionals eager to take aim and transform these real-world problems.

At Nvidia we’re dedicated to the democratization of this technology through high-performance and rigorously engineered robotics system components to enable a new generation of entrepreneurs and researchers to build future robotics applications. To achieve this, our new Isaac SDK and Simulation teams in the Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara and in Toronto, the advanced robotics R&D teams in Pittsburgh and Zurich, and the robotics research lab in Seattle are seeking world-class talent in rigorous software, hardware, and research engineering.

Robotics is highly interdisciplinary, so at Nvidia we want to learn from the best in the field across a wide range of areas. For our engineering positions, experience in areas like manipulation, vision, deep learning, navigation, localization, mapping, motion generation, control, etc. is a significant plus, but not critical. We’re seeking professional expertise in core software engineering areas such as high-performance systems design, hybrid systems, deep learning tools, real-time constraints, large-scale linear algebra and optimization, inter-process communication, low-latency multiprocessing, etc. You should have deep and professional expertise in systems development and skills that complement and augment our team of robotics researchers. Engineers will work closely with roboticists to design, develop, and rigorously test systems, so the ability to learn quickly on the job is a requirement, as is the ability to lucidly communicate engineering constraints and methodologies to interdisciplinary teams.



What you’ll be doing:
You will be coordinating with researchers to distill the state-of-the-art into a suite of software tools to support lab research; designing, developing, testing, and demoing end-to-end robotic systems integrating the latest research from subgroups in perception, planning, control, higher-level cognition, etc.
Designing frameworks and tools for component isolation and controlled experimentation leading to publication in top tier robotics, vision, and learning conferences.
Coordinating company-wide to productionize software components for integration into Nvidia’s Isaac SDK for broader commercial use.
Building demos to showcase research, especially emphasizing utility and impact in commercial settings such as collaborative manufacturing/assembly, logistics, healthcare, and emerging home applications.
What we need to see:
You have at least 4+ years professional software engineering experience.
Masters/PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related field.
Deep knowledge of C++, CUDA, and/or Python, and familiarity with deep learning tools such as TensorFlow and Torch.
Substantial experience designing and developing performance-critical software for systems such as simulation, games, autonomous vehicles, vision, control, sensor processing, etc.
You have knowledge of robotics or a related area and/or a demonstrated ability to learn and apply complex technical background quickly along with a strong desire to build some of the world’s most sophisticated robotic systems.
With competitive salaries and a generous benefits package, Nvidia is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most brilliant people in the world and our research and engineering teams are growing at an unprecedented rate. We have ambitious plans for the future of robotics, and we need your help. Are you eager to work with some of the world’s best robotics researchers and engineers to enable a new wave of robotics applications? If so, we want to hear from you.
