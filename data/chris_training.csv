We are inventing new and engaging ad experiences for customers on mobile. As a leader and engineer you will have the freedom, support and encouragement to experiment and invent on behalf of our customers. We trust you to come up with compelling new interactive mobile ad experiences. You will think big and turn vision into reality — not be constrained by resources available to you today or today’s market environments. You’ll straddle both the product perspective and engineering execution while holding the entire problem-space in your head. Paul Graham wrote an essay about the importance of this principle: http://paulgraham.com/head.html. We like to think that it’s more than the software that our engineers need to hold all at once in their heads — it’s also the customer experience, the design, and the product. This allows you to look around the corner, move efficiently, develop concrete plans, and take advantage of opportunities to solve problems with long-term thinking. We need a highly collaborative teammate, but also one-person wrecking crew — someone who gets a lot done with very little resources and lots of ambiguity.

As a Development Manager, you'll build an elite team of Development Engineers to define, drive and execute on this vision. You will initiate processes that allow the team to collaborate with partner teams in Amazon with a high degree of efficiency. You'll develop your team of highly motivated and talented individuals who can collaborate with Program Managers, Product Managers and SDEs across the company on high impact initiatives. You will design, build and own beautiful new features and solutions that will delight our customers.


Responsibilities
• You'll lead the overall development life cycle of the solutions and manage complex projects with significant bottom line impact.
• Work with our team's product managers to develop a strategy and road map to provide compelling customer experiences and capabilities.
• Cooperate with our senior engineers to develop the best technical design and approach for new product development.

We’ve built a team of not just the best engineers, but some really awesome humans as well. This team builds cloud software (platform + apps + ecosystem) to accelerate the flow of government data into the hands of citizens, developers, businesses and researchers. This means a few things:
We are solving some pretty cool data access problems (ex. how do you extract, host and visualize every taxi ride in NYC so that any resident, anywhere can access it?).
What we do matters. New York, Seattle, San Francisco and 300+ other cities, states and counties use us to connect citizens with information that matters to their day to day life.

We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who can help lead a team to build massively scalable, distributed systems for some of the most important data on the planet. We’re looking for someone who is as equally comfortable diving deep into development, as they are guiding and mentoring other engineers.

Please apply if you share our beliefs that:
You code your way out of problems, don’t talk about them
It’s healthy to laugh at yourself and your VP (he’ll provide plenty of opportunities)
A flat tire is just an opportunity to change a tire and keep going

Checking in code is part of progress, solving customer problems is having impact.

API Gateway turns daunting tasks such as traffic management, authentication and authorization, monitoring and API versioning into easily configurable steps. It then helps companies to build their developer eco-systems and turns their data sets and business logic into new revenue streams.

In this role you will own and drive exciting new initiatives on API Gateway - from building new features to improving its performance and latency. This is a highly visible position that will interact at all levels of the AWS and Amazon.com businesses and the ability to collaborate effectively with other senior leaders and customers is a key requirement for this role.

If you are excited about cloud computing and architecting highly available and large-scale services used by millions of users, then join us in making the Serverless revolution ubiquitous.

What does it take to succeed in this role? Excited by the scale at which we work. A roll-up-your-sleeves type. Able to think about business opportunities, operational issues, and architectural diagrams in the course of a single conversation. Intellectually curious and dedicated to turning developers into raving fans. Someone who makes the team room both productive and fun to work in.

You will help ensure that our software is robust in the presence of failures, scalable, and cost-effective. You will tackle intrinsically hard problems, acquiring expertise as needed. You will decompose complex problems into straightforward solutions. You will propose projects that may require the work of several teams to implement; dividing responsibilities so that each team can work independently and have the system come together into an integrated whole.

As a trusted advisor to senior legal leadership, you will take on research efforts to determine how best to apply new and emerging technology to help solve significantly complex and/or endemic problems that are present in Legal technology.

You will amplify your impact by leading design reviews for complex software and/or critical features across all Legal Technology teams. You will probe assumptions, illuminate pitfalls, and foster shared understanding. You will align teams toward coherent architectural strategies. You will educate, keeping the engineering community up to date on advanced technical issues, technologies, and trends.

SAP applications and services enable customers to operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.

 

SAP Concur takes companies of all sizes beyond automation to a completely connected spend management solution encompassing travel, expense, invoice, compliance and risk. For more than 20 years, our global expertise and industry-leading innovation has kept customers a step ahead with time-saving tools, leading-edge technology and connected data.

 

We drive innovation forward until it becomes the new normal, but we’ll never accept business as usual if there’s an opportunity for business to be better. Want to be a part of something amazing? Check us out at: concur.com/careers

Be an expert on a talented team of world-class developers. Deliver features and bug fixes for a market-leading software product for tens of millions of users. Work in an Agile environment building scalable SAAS solutions designed to perform on internet scale. Get a chance to help redefine the Travel industry!

In this role you will:

  Write back-end and middle-tier software that delivers world-class experience for your users: Concur travel is growing rapidly. Scalability, stability, and performance all rest upon a solid, transparently scalable, and robust back-end and middle-tier design. This job provides the opportunity to both define and implement these designs for a complex and challenging set of interrelated business requirements.
Learn and grow on a great team: As a Sr. SDE you will work together with a great team of experienced and engaged developers in designing new features and re-architecting existing ones. We hire smart people and then encourage them to make smart decisions rather than pushing designs from the top down.

This means that you will have the opportunity to become quite visible and broadly recognized for your expertise, thus offering the opportunity to become a well-recognized and valuable asset to the larger Concur organization.

COMPANY DESCRIPTION

 

As market leader in enterprise application software, SAP helps companies of all sizes and industries innovate through simplification. From the back office to the boardroom, warehouse to storefront, on premise to cloud, desktop to mobile device – SAP empowers people and organizations to work together more efficiently and use business insight more effectively to stay ahead of the competition. SAP applications and services enable customers to operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.

 

SAP Concur takes companies of all sizes beyond automation to a completely connected spend management solution encompassing travel, expense, invoice, compliance and risk. For more than 20 years, our global expertise and industry-leading innovation has kept customers a step ahead with time-saving tools, leading-edge technology and connected data.

 

We drive innovation forward until it becomes the new normal, but we’ll never accept business as usual if there’s an opportunity for business to be better. Want to be a part of something amazing? Check us out at: concur.com/careers

Be an expert on a talented team of world-class developers. Deliver features and bug fixes for a market-leading software product for tens of millions of users. Work in an Agile environment building scalable SAAS solutions designed to perform on internet scale. Get a chance to help redefine the Travel industry!

In this role you will:

  Write back-end and middle-tier software that delivers world-class experience for your users: Concur travel is growing rapidly. Scalability, stability, and performance all rest upon a solid, transparently scalable, and robust back-end and middle-tier design.

Learn and grow on a great team: As a Sr. SDE you will work together with a great team of experienced and engaged developers in designing new features and re-architecting existing ones.

This means that you will have the opportunity to become quite visible and broadly recognized for your expertise, thus offering the opportunity to become a well-recognized and valuable asset to the larger Concur organization.
Maintain a work/life balance: Our developers work hard and have challenging problems to solve, but we, as a company, greatly value an environment that promotes living a complete life both in and out of work. While no company can promise that extra hours will never be necessary, we do not promote a culture where this is constantly required for either growth or success.

In order to accomplish this you will:
  Take design and architecture seriously. Get the chance to design things the right way, to scale and perform as a world class product.
Take quality seriously. You have time for unit tests, integration, and automation.
Learn new skills. We don’t change technologies just for the sake of changing technologies, but we will use the right tool for the job. If the right tool is a new tool, you encouraged to adopt it.
Use interesting tools like AWS and no-SQL solutions to solve interesting challenges
Get a chance to think about how to scale a feature to millions of users, and implement your design!

COMPANY DESCRIPTION

 

As market leader in enterprise application software, SAP helps companies of all sizes and industries innovate through simplification. From the back office to the boardroom, warehouse to storefront, on premise to cloud, desktop to mobile device – SAP empowers people and organizations to work together more efficiently and use business insight more effectively to stay ahead of the competition. SAP applications and services enable customers to operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.

 

SAP Concur takes companies of all sizes beyond automation to a completely connected spend management solution encompassing travel, expense, invoice, compliance and risk. For more than 20 years, our global expertise and industry-leading innovation has kept customers a step ahead with time-saving tools, leading-edge technology and connected data.

  Take design and architecture seriously. Get the chance to design things the right way, to scale and perform as a world class product.
Take quality seriously. You have time for unit tests, integration, and automation.

Use interesting tools like AWS and no-SQL solutions to solve interesting challenges
Get a chance to think about how to scale a feature to millions of users, and implement your design!

As market leader in enterprise application software, SAP helps companies of all sizes and industries innovate through simplification. From the back office to the boardroom, warehouse to storefront, on premise to cloud, desktop to mobile device – SAP empowers people and organizations to work together more efficiently and use business insight more effectively to stay ahead of the competition. SAP applications and services enable customers to operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.

 

SAP Concur takes companies of all sizes beyond automation to a completely connected spend management solution encompassing travel, expense, invoice, compliance and risk. For more than 20 years, our global expertise and industry-leading innovation has kept customers a step ahead with time-saving tools, leading-edge technology and connected data.

This means that you will have the opportunity to become quite visible and broadly recognized for your expertise, thus offering the opportunity to become a well-recognized and valuable asset to the larger Concur organization.

  Take design and architecture seriously. Get the chance to design things the right way, to scale and perform as a world class product.
Take quality seriously. You have time for unit tests, integration, and automation.
Learn new skills. We don’t change technologies just for the sake of changing technologies, but we will use the right tool for the job. If the right tool is a new tool, you encouraged to adopt it.
Use interesting tools like AWS and no-SQL solutions to solve interesting challenges
Get a chance to think about how to scale a feature to millions of users, and implement your design!
