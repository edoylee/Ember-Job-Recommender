0,"At any level, in any company, my motivation is always the same.

Melville said it best: ""I am tormented by an everlasting itch for things remote."" In business I translate this as a never ending drive for change. I see disruption of the normal as the best way forward, always.

My teams are encouraged, cajoled, and ultimately driven to different ways of thinking. Average, standard, and usual are never words used to describe the work I participate in.

Passionate about collaboration and agile methodologies, I refuse to believe a thing cannot be improved. I strive to keep myself surrounded by people smarter than me who are not afraid to express opinions and call me out on mine.

I have a diverse background in leadership, software development, business technology, and project management. In all these areas I have experimented constantly. My least successful endeavors have been those where I did not question the process, but merely played along.

I have a proven track record overseeing complex operations. I thrive on managing multiple, overlapping projects with shared resources and constrained budgets. Motivating disparate teams across both geographical and disciplinary distances pushes me to always find better, faster, more efficient ways to succeed.

I'm highly motivated, immensely ethical, and never willing to give up.

This is me today, but change is always in the air and tomorrow I might be something different. Change is hard, but it keeps us alive and young. I can't think of anything more enticing. Experience

Keith Aubin
Sr. Director of Development at Ascend Analytics
July 6, 2013, Keith worked with Chris in different groups
Chris has a keen business sense of what should and should not be done in a software company at a high level, and the technical know-how to understand the software development process and all of its complex details. Chris came in as a fresh face to both his team and the company. He was able to take a morale challenged team and turn them around quickly by assessing and addressing the relevant challenges. This accomplishment was just the first of many examples that demonstrated his ability to quickly grasp the core issues at hand and take the appropriate actions to rectify them regardless of the difficulty or popularity of those actions. Additionally, Chris was good to work with and is always a pleasure to talk to. I give him my full recommendation.
Simon Taranto
👋 Software Engineer | Product Builder
June 27, 2013, Simon reported directly to Chris
Chris was an engaged and approachable manager. From his broad industry experiences to software expertise I learned something new from every conversation I had with him. Chris excels at managing technical teams working on multiple complex projects and is a true pleasure to work with.
Andrew Tracy
Software Engineer at Seegrid
May 16, 2013, Andrew reported directly to Chris
I was glad to be managed by Chris while working at Ascend Analytics. Chris excelled at managing projects, had the technical skills necessary to produce an effective software product, and inspired those around him with his own enthusiasm. At an early stage in my professional career, he was an excellent role model.

Chris was very good at collaborating with others inside the company to accomplish what needed to be done. He was equally effective at listening to others' ideas and expressing his own. Chris, more than anyone else at the company, took the interest of his fellow employees to mind when making decisions. He also handled client relationships very well was instrumental in maintaining a number of critical accounts.

Chris gave me the opportunity to express ideas for a number of projects that I envisioned and made sure I had the resources I needed to see them through to completion, including a time-management tool and a software testing framework.

I would highly recommend Chris.
Amy Fowler Stadler
Client Executive/Managing Partner/Founder/Visionary Technology Executive, Transformation Leader
May 3, 2013, Amy worked with Chris but at different companies
Chris and I worked together on a large program effort for several Pacific Northwest customers. While the program had many challenges, I felt Chris worked with my team in a very professional and capable manner. Chris always tried to negotiate positive solutions and outcomes for all parties involved. Chris worked with his technology team to drive results and customer service. I would work with Chris again in a heartbeat.
Steve Reaser
Founder, Scratch Labs
April 30, 2013, Chris worked with Steve in the same group
It's rare to find someone who can build and manage a high-performing technical team who just happens to also be able to architect and program complex software systems... but that's what you get in Chris Doyle.

In our work at Funding Launchpad / Vim Funding we were creating a platform from scratch with little in the way of resources or pre-built design specs. Chris was able to help us organize our requirements, architect a robust system, and iterate the platform rapidly as we learned from early customers. He is an expert at planning ahead without over-engineering, and was always easy to communicate with -- not always the case with highly technical folks.

In a nutshell: if I were building my dream team Chris is absolutely one of the people I would want on board.
Natasha Whitney
Software Engineer
April 21, 2013, Natasha reported directly to Chris
I had the pleasure of reporting directly to Chris at Ascend Analytics. Chris came on board and became effective as Director of Software Services almost immediately, quickly familiarizing himself with the particulars of each project and developing actionable and achievable directives for them and for the Services team at large. For example, Chris implemented Services Scrum activities, requiring each team-member to complete one weekly task that improved operations for the whole team. Chris also prioritized involvement and feedback, frequently touching base with each individual about their ongoing responsibilities as well as establishing a relationship with the primary contacts for each project early on. With Chris' feedback and direction, I was able to streamline the projects that I was working on as well as improve the overall service that I provided.
Dave Milliken
I grow brands. From startup through Fortune 500 I have a track record of driving sales and brand equity growth.
April 19, 2013, Dave worked with Chris in different groups
Chris is a dynamic contributor to any technical team. Not only is he an excellent programmer and manager of technical people, he also has an exceptional mind for business. So much so I never hesitated putting Chris in front of potential clients or including him in vital strategic decisions.
