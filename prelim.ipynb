       "['Ask for a recommendation\\nRecommend Chris\\nRecommendations\\nReceived (13)\\nGiven (10)\\nKeith Aubin\\nSr. Director of Development at Ascend Analytics\\nJuly 6, 2013, Keith worked with Chris in different groups\\nChris has a keen business sense of what should and should not be done in a software company at a high level, and the technical know-how to understand the software development process and all of its complex details. Chris came in as a fresh face to both his team and the company. He was able to take a morale challenged team and turn them around quickly by assessing and addressing the relevant challenges. This accomplishment was just the first of many examples that demonstrated his ability to quickly grasp the core issues at hand and take the appropriate actions to rectify them regardless of the difficulty or popularity of those actions. Additionally, Chris was good to work with and is always a pleasure to talk to. I give him my full recommendation.\\nSimon Taranto\\n👋 Software Engineer | Product Builder\\nJune 27, 2013, Simon reported directly to Chris\\nChris was an engaged and approachable manager. From his broad industry experiences to software expertise I learned something new from every conversation I had with him. Chris excels at managing technical teams working on multiple complex projects and is a true pleasure to work with.\\nAndrew Tracy\\nSoftware Engineer at Seegrid\\nMay 16, 2013, Andrew reported directly to Chris\\nI was glad to be managed by Chris while working at Ascend Analytics. Chris excelled at managing projects, had the technical skills necessary to produce an effective software product, and inspired those around him with his own enthusiasm. At an early stage in my professional career, he was an excellent role model.\\n\\nChris was very good at collaborating with others inside the company to accomplish what needed to be done. He was equally effective at listening to others\\' ideas and expressing his own. Chris, more than anyone else at the company, took the interest of his fellow employees to mind when making decisions. He also handled client relationships very well was instrumental in maintaining a number of critical accounts.\\n\\nChris gave me the opportunity to express ideas for a number of projects that I envisioned and made sure I had the resources I needed to see them through to completion, including a time-management tool and a software testing framework.\\n\\nI would highly recommend Chris.\\nAmy Fowler Stadler\\nClient Executive/Managing Partner/Founder/Visionary Technology Executive, Transformation Leader\\nMay 3, 2013, Amy worked with Chris but at different companies\\nChris and I worked together on a large program effort for several Pacific Northwest customers. While the program had many challenges, I felt Chris worked with my team in a very professional and capable manner. Chris always tried to negotiate positive solutions and outcomes for all parties involved. Chris worked with his technology team to drive results and customer service. I would work with Chris again in a heartbeat.\\nSteve Reaser\\nFounder, Scratch Labs\\nApril 30, 2013, Chris worked with Steve in the same group\\nIt\\'s rare to find someone who can build and manage a high-performing technical team who just happens to also be able to architect and program complex software systems... but that\\'s what you get in Chris Doyle.\\n\\nIn our work at Funding Launchpad / Vim Funding we were creating a platform from scratch with little in the way of resources or pre-built design specs. Chris was able to help us organize our requirements, architect a robust system, and iterate the platform rapidly as we learned from early customers. He is an expert at planning ahead without over-engineering, and was always easy to communicate with -- not always the case with highly technical folks.\\n\\nIn a nutshell: if I were building my dream team Chris is absolutely one of the people I would want on board.\\nNatasha Whitney\\nSoftware Engineer\\nApril 21, 2013, Natasha reported directly to Chris\\nI had the pleasure of reporting directly to Chris at Ascend Analytics. Chris came on board and became effective as Director of Software Services almost immediately, quickly familiarizing himself with the particulars of each project and developing actionable and achievable directives for them and for the Services team at large. For example, Chris implemented Services Scrum activities, requiring each team-member to complete one weekly task that improved operations for the whole team. Chris also prioritized involvement and feedback, frequently touching base with each individual about their ongoing responsibilities as well as establishing a relationship with the primary contacts for each project early on. With Chris\\' feedback and direction, I was able to streamline the projects that I was working on as well as improve the overall service that I provided.\\nDave Milliken\\nI grow brands. From startup through Fortune 500 I have a track record of driving sales and brand equity growth.\\nApril 19, 2013, Dave worked with Chris in different groups\\nChris is a dynamic contributor to any technical team. Not only is he an excellent programmer and manager of technical people, he also has an exceptional mind for business. So much so I never hesitated putting Chris in front of potential clients or including him in vital strategic decisions.\\nShane Fleenor\\nAttorney at Rubicon Law\\nApril 18, 2013, Chris worked with Shane in the same group\\nI couldn\\'t have hoped for a better co-founder than Chris. He has a tireless work effort (seriously, he never seems to sleep). He is one of those rare souls who understands both the technical/code side of the business, and the \"business\" side of the business. He can manage a team of developers, or give a presentation to clients and business partners -- and absolutely excel at both. And on top of all that, he\\'s just a great guy (he helped me install some shelves at my apartment after a team meeting one day), and fun to be around/grab a beer after work with. He\\'d be an asset to any organization lucky enough to have him.\\nMichael Gadsden\\nDirector at Cornerstone Financial Advisors, LLC\\nApril 18, 2013, Michael reported directly to Chris\\nI had the pleasure of working under Chris\\'s management at Ascend Analytics. He is a charismatic and effective team leader who inspired the group to pursue creative ideas to solve complex issues. He has an entrepreneurial and pragmatic attitude, and he is not afraid to speak his mind - or even ruffle some feathers on occasion - to get the work done and impact positive change. He was a true advocate for his employees\\' well-being, and he took great care to connect with each and every person on both a professional and a personal level. On top of his strong managerial and leadership capabilities, Chris is a talented software developer and an experienced IT professional. I strongly recommend Chris Doyle as a manager and a friend.\\nGalen Brown\\nSenior Quantitative Analyst\\nApril 16, 2013, Galen reported directly to Chris\\nChris is a driven and strategic manager, whom I have enjoyed working under for the past year. Chris has always put an emphasis on communicating with me, both the immediate directives at hand, and the larger vision of projects and the company--which gives me great confidence and direction to accomplish the objectives. I can always count on him for honest and direct feedback, both positive and negative, from which I have learned how to better myself, and conduct business in general. I owe a debt of gratitude to Chris for his mentorship.\\nDavid Leevan\\nManaging Director at cQuant.io\\nApril 1, 2013, David worked with Chris in different groups\\nI had the pleasure of working with Chris at Ascend Analytics. Chris has a unique skill set that adapts easily to technical management, product development, software implementation and team leadership.\\n\\nAt Ascend, Chris was asked to stabilize a chaotic and inefficient client services team as well as take charge of important client relationships. Chris successfully improved the operation and outcomes in both areas. I highly recommend Chris for his leadership, management and software expertise.\\nBill Townsend\\nCEO Live Power\\nFebruary 13, 2012, Bill worked with Chris in different groups\\nI have worked with Chris in a number of different roles over the past 10 years. He is a intelligence, organized and tenacious guy who can manage multiple projects and teams at the same time. His enthusiasm is contagious and I always get a positive energy from working with him on building a new vision of where we want to go as well as working alongside him in the trenches. I\\'d work with Chris again in heartbeat.\\nAri Gluck\\nTechnology Consultant and Strategist\\nAugust 16, 2011, Ari reported directly to Chris\\nI worked under Chris\\' supervision during the late 1990s dot come boom, when good help was hard to find, and good technology managers were even rarer. He is still the standard I compare others to in many areas. In particular, his ability to think and act strategically to achieve long term goals, as well as his ability to delegate and motivate his team to focus on those goals was exceptional (almost freakish). His communications were clear and honest, whether in praise or critical, and it led to a very effective, and cooperative working environment. He showed excellent adaptability, as his job function, team, and the entire nature of the technology industry was going berserk around us.\\nChris showed enormous integrity and leadership throughout the time I worked with him, and I highly recommend him.']"
