## Tinder for Jobs (DSI - Capstone Project 2018)

#### Overview

  The search for a new job is a long and tedious process filled with several frustrations. Job sites attempt to alleviate some of this frustration with advanced filters such as: location, salary range, size of company, and company ranking. Even with these filters however, users continue to face job postings that do not meet their criteria. This problem forces people to scan through dozens of jobs and save the ones they like and discard the rest.
  
  A potential solution would be to sort the postings from most similar to your criteria to least similiar
